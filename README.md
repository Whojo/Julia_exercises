# Julia_exercises

A small repository regrouping some exercises I have done on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/julia) to **learn Julia**.
Here are the exercise I have done:
- [Difference Of Squares](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/julia/difference-of-squares)
- [Hello World](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/julia/hello-world)
- [Leap](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/julia/leap)
- [Nucleotide Count](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/juliafn)
- [Pangram](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/juliafn)
- [Raindrops](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/juliafn)
- [Rotational Cipher](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/julia/rotational-cipher)

This package also include a mini-package that I wrote to learn the whole Julia Packaging environment: [MyMiniPackage](https://github.com/Whojo/Julia_exercises/tree/main/MyMiniPackage)

This has been undergone during the "Community Bonding Period" of my Google Summer of Code in 2022. See [My Google Summer of Code repository](https://github.com/Whojo/AlphaZero.jl) for more details.
